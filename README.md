# Project Title

Global Function Challenge

## Getting Started

This Solidity contract demonstrates the use of global variables and functions related to message context, including `msg.sender`, `msg.value`, `gasleft()`, `tx.gasprice`, `block.number`, and `block.timestamp`. The contract provides a function to retrieve these values from the message context.

## Executing Program

To deploy and interact with the contract, you can use a development environment such as Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Deploy the contract to a development blockchain.
2. Use the `getMessageContext` function to retrieve the message context values.

## Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the contract, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the authors for assistance.
